      <p>Hello. This is just a super basic note taking app that I am building just to test out Next.js framework. </p>
      <p>If you navigate to the Notes directory, you can create notes with a title, and they will dynamically appear on the page.</p>
      <p>This was built with pocketbase from <a href="https://pocketbase.io/" target="_blank">pocketbase.io</a>, download it and sign in to use it with this project.</p>
